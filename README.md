# Homework #2

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	### for loop
	The for loop iterates through a sequence, like a countdown to limit the conditions where a function performs the programmed tasks.  The iteration uses the integer __i__ to act as the countdown variable.
	### && || !
	Double ampersands act as an __and__ logical operand to link statements together that must be performed together in order to create either a true or false condition.  Double pipes act as an __or__ logical operand to tie statements together so if either is true the condition is set to true.  The bang operand acts as a __reversal__ condition, and it reverses the boolean value of the condition it is attached to.  
	### Array
	An array is a variable that stores multiple types of data, like strings, integers, and booleans.  They are recalled by their location in teh array or by their tag if they are notated with a name.  The individual elements can be called and manipulated just like a normal var variable can.
	### git
	Git is the local repository created on a computer where a file or folders are kept for working purposes.  They are tracked by the revision status kept locally on the machine and later compared to the ghost repository online at GitHub.
	### GitHub
	GitHub is the ghost or cloud repository that mirrors the locally archived one.  It is commonly used for revision control and for collaborative working on projects.  It also acts as a backup for revisionary purposes so when a modification to code breaks the functionality, the code can be retrograded to a previous version for further troubleshooting and collaboration.
